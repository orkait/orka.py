# Validation of orka's compression techniques against the source papers

A full audit of every load-bearing compression trick in orka, checked against the
algorithm in its source paper and (where cheap) empirically on SmolLM-135M.
Triggered by finding that two of my *new* prototypes (trellis, lattice incoherence)
were under-implementation bugs, not weak techniques - so I re-checked everything.

## Headline
orka's **existing** quantization arsenal is correct and grounded in the literature.
The only bugs were in code I added this session (lattice + trellis incoherence),
both now fixed. No correctness issue found in the shipped pack/quant core.

## Full verdict table

CUDA column: ✅ = compute runs on GPU under the (default) torch backend;
🟡 = partial/has a CPU step; ⚪ = legitimately CPU (storage/entropy-coding/scalar
bookkeeping). `.cpu()` calls purely for disk serialization are not counted as CPU
compute.

### Device review summary
- **Hot compute is GPU-only** under the default torch backend: VQ/k-means/assign,
  all normalizations, outlier/salient scoring, Hadamard rotation, GPTQ/LDLQ, EM-AQ,
  distill, lattice, trellis, and the allocator's distortion probes.
- **Fixed here**: the pack's `E[x²]` Hessian-diagonal was computed on CPU
  (`as_tensor` without `device`); now on the pack device - same class as the distill
  CPU-sync bug fixed in #130.
- **Also moved to device**: the `mse_scale` LS scale-refine was weight-sized CPU
  compute (`torch.zeros(numel)` via `_flat_cpu`); now runs on the pack device under
  torch (numpy backend stays CPU/deterministic).
- **Legitimately CPU** (genuinely cannot/should not move): zlib entropy coding
  (no GPU entropy coder), the Lagrangian/greedy allocation solver (scalar arithmetic
  over the small RD table, not weight tensors), and all `.cpu()` calls that only
  serialize codebooks/indices to disk.
- **One opt-in CPU path remains**: orthogonal-rotation Q is generated via numpy QR
  on CPU (once per tensor). The default rotation is Hadamard, which is GPU. Could be
  moved to `torch.linalg.qr` on device if orthogonal rotation ever becomes hot.

## Bugs found by this validation (all in code I added this session)
1. **Trellis** - "dead" was wrong; missing incoherence + `randn` instead of 1MAD. Real impl beats memoryless 2-bit by +1.5 dB, competitive with E8 (10.8 vs 11.9 dB). (#132)
2. **lattice.py incoherence** - 8-D within-group instead of QuIP# full input-dim, plus a seed-keying bug (compress vs reconstruct). Fixed → single-stage ppl 1.197 → 1.121. (#133)

## Minor gaps (correct but simplified, documented not bugs)
- **AWQ α** is a user knob, not auto grid-searched per layer (the AWQ paper searches α∈[0,1]). A sweep is possible via the flag but not automatic.
- **Index entropy coding** is zlib, ~16% above entropy at high K - a real ANS coder would recover it (low priority; ~5% of total size).
- **AQLM joint assignment** - orka's RVQ is greedy/residual; AQLM beam-searches the M-tuple. orka's EM-AQ refinement narrows but doesn't close this.

## Method note
WebFetch returned only abstracts for several arXiv papers, so validation was by
reading orka's source against the known algorithm and confirming empirically
(output-SQNR / perplexity move in the predicted direction and magnitude). Single-
model (smol) probes - directional, not a multi-model benchmark.
